# Learning Roadmap

Starting any new learning journey can be daunting. As a visual learner, I like to see the big picture of what I need to learn, and the paths that help me navigate avaiable resources in a structured way. I love using [markmaps](https://markmap.js.org/) to organize, customize, and visualize knowledge around this topic.

!!! tip "3 Tips for using markmaps effectively"
    1. **Nodes Are Collapsible**: Click a node to collapse or expand its children. (Filled nodes = can be expanded)
    2. **Zoom In/Out**: Use the mouse or touch to zoom in and out of the map or move it around.
    3. **Annotate**: Add custom subsections or lists to original Markdown file to update the map.
